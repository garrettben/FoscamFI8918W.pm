Tweaked Foscam FI8918W Zoneminder Control Script


Adding this repo, as this module has not been maintained for some time, and I figure there are still 
folks out there who use this camera with newer versions of ZoneMinder.  As far as I know everything works
well, though I've tweaked it to be an inverted camera, and I changed the presets and steps to be a little 
more smartphone friendly.  See the wonderful "IP Cam Viewer Pro" Android app for a good realtime ZM-compatible 
control and viewer.
